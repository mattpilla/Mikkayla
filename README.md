# Mikkayla
Made with [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/)

Mikkayla is a very personalized bot specifically designed around my own use.
With voice support, this project now runs best in a Linux environment, with dependencies like ffmpeg and g++. If for some ridiculous reason you want to use this, create `auth.json` and `conf.json` with the example files to guide you.
